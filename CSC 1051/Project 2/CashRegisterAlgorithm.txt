Cash Register Algorithm

Complete each of the following five items to create your algorithm.

1. List all of the input(s) and output(s).

Inputs: 
Amount(in cents)

Outputs:
Specific coins needed for input amount-
Number of quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies

2. Figure out the computations needed to calculate outputs from the input.

   quarters: amount / 25 = quarters ; amount % 25 = amount_1
   
   dimes: amount_1 / 10 = dimes ;  amount_1 % 10 = amount_2
   
   nickels: amount_2 / 5 = nickels ; amount_2 % 5 = amount_3 
   
   pennies: amount_3 / 1 = pennies ; amount_3 % 1 = amount_4
   

3. Write all of the variable declarations needed for your inputs, outputs 
   and computational results.
   
   int q     int amount    
   int d     int amount1
   int n     int amount2
   int p     int amount3
   
   
  

4. Translate the computations described into Java expressions and statements.

   int amount = scan.nextInt();
   
   quarters:
   int q = amount / 25;
   int amount1 = amount % 25;
   
   dimes:
   int d = amount_1 / 10;
   int amount2 = amount1 % 10;
   
   nickels:
   int n = amount_2 / 5;
   int amount3 = amount2 % 5;
   
   pennies:
   int p = amount_3 / 1;
  
   


5. Describe your algorithm in pseudocode: how you will collect input, perform
   calculations, and produce output.
   
Prompt user to input amount (in cents)

Get input amount 

For quarters, the quotient from the amount divided by the coin value yeilds the number of quarters needed in the specific amount
while the remainder yeilds the cents left to be processed. 

A new amount is used for every coin value, then it's divided by the corresponding value.

if the quotient for amount / coin value = 1
   print number of coin and singular form for specific coin
else
   print number of coin the plural form
